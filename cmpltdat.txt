INTRODUCTION:
_____________________________________________________
This program contains the databases of complete that
use to be internal.  They are made external so that
you can archive them and save ram memory space.

Also if you execute this program you can change
the settings of complete.  In order for the settings
to be remembered the program cmpltdat must not be
archived.  It does not matter if complete is archived.

Once you have the settings set the way you want then
you can archive cmpltdat.





SETTINGS:
____________________________________________________
The text shown is the current setting, not what
pressing the corresponding key changes the setting
to.

Press escape to exit.


-MENU SIZE-
	Press 1 to toggle the size of the menu between
	small and large.  The default is large.


-MENU MOVEMENT-
	By default once the menu is displayed it no
	longer moves around with the cursor.  Use
	this option to make it move around with the
	cursor.

	Personally I find having the menu move with
	the cursor distracting.  Also it will slow things
	down a little bit because it has to restore part of
	the screen and then backup the new part of the screen
	whenever something is typed.  But not that you will
	notice the speed decrease.


-_XTRAST1 USAGE-
	If you never use the external database _xtrast1
	then use this option to disable it.  By default
	it will be set.  This will speed things up a
	little bit.  But not that you will notice the
	speed increase.

	This option is for those of you who are paranoid
	about battery usage.


-SET RIGHT KEY-
	The 'right' key is the key that scrolls the unit
	menu right and changes a normal menu to a menu
	containing only folders and variables.  If you
	want you can change the key that performs these
	two actions to any key you want.

	The advantage to doing this is that by changing
	this key to something like [catalog] you can use
	the right arrow key to move the cursor.

	This will affect the unit menu, but not the replacement
	of tios's unit menu.

	To use this option press 4 and then it will prompt you
	to enter a key.  Do so, this key now performs the
	'right' key response.

	Remember [apps] is used in the unit menu to get a listing
	of shortcuts so do not use [apps].

	It does no checking of the key you choose.  If you want
	you could make this key be f1, but that would be stupid.


-SET MUCH RIGHT KEY-
	This is the key that makes the unit menu scroll right
	skipping the unit types that have been printed in the
	help line.


-SET LEFT KEY-
	This is the key that scrolls the unit menu left and
	results in a menu of system variables.


-EXTERNAL DATABASES USE _-
	All of complete's external databases start with an
	underscore.  The advantage to this is that they can
	then be placed into a fake unit menu that has all of
	complete's external data base names.

	The disadvantage to this is that tios does not let
	variables that start with an underscore to be archived.
	So this option lets you change the naming convention.

	So '_xtrast1' becomes 'xtrast1'.  However the external
	data base names will still be stored with the underscore.
	So you will still have to type the underscore, pick the
	external data base name you want, move the cursor to the
	leading underscore and then delete it.
