This program is designed extensively to aid in the typing of valid
expressions into the home entry line.  And it absolutely kills at
this.  It is not designed to aid in the typing of sentences, ect.

It is also my interface to variables and programs: my own personal
shell.





INTRODUCTION:
_________________________________________________________________
This program is an event hook.  It will monitor what you type
into the entry line and in the form of a menu it will offer
suggestions as to how the stuff typed in can be completed.

For example if you type in the lower case "a" character
the user will receive a menu with the following options:

	1: abs(
	2: ans(
	3: and			<-There is an unseen space after
	4: approx(			  the and.
	5: arcLen(
	6: avgRC(
	7: augment(
	8: angle(			<-There will be a down arrow because
					  the user can scroll the menu to
					  receive more options.


The 1, 2, 3, ect refer to f1, f2, f3, not the number keys.

If after the "a" you typed an "n" then you would receive a
menu with the following:

	1: ans(
	2: and
	3: angle(


If it tries to do a menu with only 1 item in it then instead the
text will be pasted and highlighted like with internet explorer
and the other auto completion tsr Ash.

It also offers suggestions as to how names of variables and folders
can be auto finished.  If you auto finish a name of a folder then
it will assume the next thing that you want to type in is the name
of a file in that folder so you will instantly receive a menu with
the names of all variables in that folder.  And it will only give
completion suggestions of the variables in that folder.

And something that I really hate about tios is the unit menu.
If I wanted to do force conversions I would  A)Have to wade
through the unit menu to the listing of force units.  B)Select
a unit to convert from.  C)And then I would have to wade
through the unit menu all over again to get back to the force
units to find the unit to convert to.

I have solved this in Complete.  It will remember the type of
unit that was last in the title bar.  The unit menu is activated
by the "_" character.  And if the unit menu is visible the
parts of the next 6 unit titles (as you scroll right) will be
displayed in the status line so that you can see what is upcoming
and be able to bypass them by pressing 2nd+right if you do not
want any of them.

In addition, Complete provides an outright replacement for the
unit menu which is available from all apps.  See documentation
somewhere below.





INSTALLATION:
___________________________________________________________
Send the program to your calc and run it.  It will then
be installed.  It has been tested on ams versions 1.00,
2.03, and 2.05 on vti.  And on my 2.05 (used to be 2.03)
HW1 calculator.  Once installed you can delete it from
your calc, but you will need to install again after a
reset or if the calc crashes.

You will also need to have the file cmpltdat on your calculatore.
The internal databases are now external.

If you have a HW2 calculator with an AMS versions greater
than 1.05 you will need to install h220xTsr by Kevin Kofler
before Complete if you have not used the HW2 patch.  You
can get it from ticalc.org or from Kevin Kofler's website
(see his event hook uninstaller read me included in this
zip file.)

An exepacked version of Complete is also included.  If you
wish to use it you will need the program ttstart.  The .89z
version of Complete is NOT the launcher for the exepacked
version. 

I consider it silly for there to be hundreds of custom exepact
launchers floating around when it is much smaller to make one
basic program that launches the compressed program with ttstart.





UNINSTALLATION:
____________________________________________________________
To uninstall Complete (why uninstall it?), use the included
event hook uninstaller by Kevin Kofler.  If you are not
already familiar with the uninstaller then be sure to read
the event hook uninstaller documentation included and know
that it has it's own license.





KEY USAGE WHEN THE MENU IS VISIBLE:
____________________________________________________________
The idea is simple: the user types letters of commands
and will receive back a menu of how the command could
be completed.  If you look at the menu you will see a
function key in front of each option.  Pressing the
function key causes the text behind it to be pasted to
the entry line.

Though really you will have to play around with it
to get the feeling of it.




	HOW THE FUNCTION KEYS WORK:
	___________________________________________________
	If the menu is visible then it pastes the
	corresponding text into the entry line.

	If you press a function key that has no corresponding
	text nothing will happen.

	If the menu is not visible (such as by pressing
	escape) then the function keys will drive the
	home screen toolbar.



	HOW DIAMOND + FUNCTION KEYS WORK:
	___________________________________________________
	Diamond + function keys will only work for f1-f5
	on the 89.  And While the menu is visible they will
	override the existing diamond + Function key results.

	So what does it do?  If the corresponding string is
	a variable name then that string is set as the
	current folder, the part of the folder name that you
	had already partially typed is deleted, and you instantly
	receive a menu of all the variables in the new current
	folder.

	It is supposed to be like pressing a function key
	with a folder associated with it in the famous RPN
	program for the 89 (download area of sq.calc.org)
	or the 49g.



	HOW THE UP AND DOWN ARROWS WORK:
	___________________________________________________
	If the menu is visible then it will scroll
	through up to 12 pages of possible options to
	paste.

	If you can scroll up then an upward pointing arrow
	is in place of the 1 of the "F1:" label.  And if
	the menu can be scrolled down then a downward
	pointing arrow is in place of the 8 of the "F8:"
	label.

	When scrolling up and down the menu will wrap.  The
	arrows do not depict this however.



	HOW THE "_" CHARACTER WORKS:
	___________________________________________________
	If this is the first character of a variable name
	then it activates the unit menu.



	HOW THE OTHER CHARACTERS WORK:
	___________________________________________________
	If a character is typed it does searching and if
	any possible matches are found then the menu is
	displayed with those matches.  The "_" character
	has special functionality.

	If no matches are found then the menu is gotten rid
	of, if it was already displayed.  And entire matches
	are ignored.

	Typing more characters will narrow down the search
	to strings starting with only those chars.



	HOW RIGHT AND LEFT WORK:
	____________________________________________________
	If a unit menu is active then it scrolls between
	the different types of units like distance and speed.
	If you scroll past the last unit menu (which actually
	contains no units) then it wraps to the first unit
	type.

	If a normal menu is available then these keys will
	move between 3 "pages."  The default page has stuff
	from the external databases, folder names and names of
	variables in current folder.

	From this page if you press right then you get a
	listing of just the names of folders and names of
	variables in the current folder.  Pressing left
	will take you to the listing of system variables.

	From these two pages you can use the arrows to go back
	to the default page and from there to the other page.

	If you can press right to get just the folders and
	variables listed, then a right arrow will be printed
	in the title bar.



	HOW BACKSPACE WORKS:
	___________________________________________________
	Backspace will remove the last letter entered and
	will un-narrow the search.  If all letters are taken
	away from the command being entered then the menu
	will disappear.



	2ND + Right
	___________________________________________________
	This only has functionality during a unit menu. It
	causes the menu to scroll right 7 times to bypass
	the unit titles that have been printed in the status
	line.  If you go too far right it will wrap around.

	If this combo is pressed during the the normal menu
	it will be treated like any other key.



	DIAMOND + SPACE:
	___________________________________________________
	This only has functionality on the 92+.  It makes
	diamond + space = Right Arrow.  Why is this useful?
	If you have text pasted and highlighted and you want
	to keep the highlighted text then you need to press
	the right arrow.  Or if the menu is visible and you
	want only variables to be listed then you can press
	diamond + space instead of the right arrow.

	So you do not have to stretch your hand up to the
	arrow.

	If the menu is visible then diamond + space is equal
	to the key that you assigned to be the right key with
	cmpltdat.

	If the menu is not visible then diamond + space will
	always be the right arrow key, regardless of the setting
	in cmpltdat.



	HOW ANY OF THE OTHER KEYS WORK:
	____________________________________________________
	If any of the other keys are pressed it assumes that
	the user is no longer interested in the command that
	is being typed so my menu will disappear.

	My menu will come back up when the user starts to
	type again.




KEY USAGE WHEN MENU IS NOT VISIBLE:
________________________________________________________________
Diamond + space is still equivalent to the right arrow on the
92+ whether or not the menu is visible.  These key combos are
used to provide even quicker access to variables.



	HOW 2ND + DOWN WORKS:
	____________________________________________________
	It results in an instant menu of all system
	variables.  From this menu you can scroll right to
	the menu of commands and from the menu of commands
	to the menu	with only folders and variables.

	There is sort of a bug in complete here:  If you
	change to the menu with only commands in it, there
	will be no right arrow in the title indicating that
	the menu can be scrolled right to the folders and
	variables.



	HOW DOWN WORKS:
	______________________________________________________
	It will result in an instant menu containing all
	variables in the current folder.



	2ND + UP:
	_______________________________________________________
	This is like the up directory key on my 49g.  All it
	does is make the current folder: main\





FOLDERS/VARIABLES SUPPORT:
______________________________________________________________
Complete will also offer suggestions for folders and other
variable names.  These suggestions will be listed last
after the other suggestions.  Folder suggestions will be
listed before variable suggestions.  To instantly skip to
the folders and variables just press the right arrow.  This
key can be changed with the use of cmpltdat.89z

Folders will have a '\' after them and programs (basic and
assembly) will have a '(' after them.  Other file types
will have a letter after them which tells you their file
type, this letter will not be pasted.  Also assembly and
basic programs do not have a letter after them; this is
deliberate.

	Letter	File Type
	_____________________________
	E		Expression
	S		String
	D		Data
	L		List
	M(up case)	Matrix
	m(low case)	Macro, although only the 92+ has this
	G		Graph Database
	P		Picture
	T		Text
	F		Figure, again it is the 92+ that has this.
	O		Other


Complete also has special behavior with folders.  If you auto complete
a folder name then you instantly get a menu with only variables in
that folder.  And if you type stuff behind a folder name already in
the entry line (not necessarily an auto completed folder name) then
complete will only give you suggestions of variables in that folder.
See examples in "things to try.txt"





UNIT SUPPORT:
______________________________________________________________
As noted above, if a variable is STARTED with an underscore
then the unit menu is active.  The unit menu is just like
a normal menu except that the unit type is printed in the
title line AND the right and left arrows change the unit
type.  In addition to the unit menu there is an outright
replacement for tios's unit menu that you get by pressing 2nd+
units.

The partial titles of the next six menu titles are printed
in the help line.  If you do not see the unit type you
want press 2nd + right to bypass all of them.  When you do
see the unit type you want then use the right arrow to
scroll to it.

The last three unit menus as you scroll right are "fake."
The first "fake" unit menu contains the names of complete's
variables.  The 2nd "fake" unit menu will have all the
variables in the vat that start with an underscore.  The
third will have external strings from the external database
_xtrast1, but not from _xtrast2.

If you continue to type stuff after the underscore, and
complete can not find a match in the current unit type, then
complete will repeatedly change the unit type till a match
is found or it exhausts all the unit types.  Automatic
changing of the unit type is the same as if you had manually
scrolled right.  If you manually change the unit type with
the arrows it skips the unit types for which there are no
matches.  The result of this could be circular:

	E.G. type "_x" and the fake unit menu that has Complete's
	variables in it will be visible.  Then try to scroll right
	or left, there are no matches in any other unit type and
	the result is that it comes right back to the unit menu
	containg complete's variables.

	E.G. type "_c" then use the arrows to scroll and it will
	only scroll to the unit types that have a match for the
	"_c".  This is an example where it is not circular.

The constants unit menu contains extra text to help remember what
each constant is.  The 49g has this in it's constant library, which
is full screen, so the extra text is not abbreviated like it is in
complete.

The shortcuts provided in the replacement of tios's unit menu are
available during the unit menu: press apps to get the listing of
shortcuts and then press the corresponding shortcut key.  F1-f8 do
not jump you to the unit type behind them.  And if you press a non-
shortcut key then the menu will revert back to the previous unit type.





SYSTEM VARIABLE SUPPORT:
_______________________________________________________________
The system variable support is designed so that the user has
quick access to the system variables, without the system
variables actually being in the main menu.

If the system variables appeared in the main menu there would
be too many objects in the menu, so it would feel cramped and
I would not like that.  (If you the user want a system variable
to appear in the main menu then put it in an external database,
which are described below.)

So to get a listing of the system variables that can be auto
completed, (based on what you already have typed in) merely
press the left arrow.  To go back to the normal menu press
the right arrow.

Statistic system variables will be proceeded by an S character
to denote that they are a statistics variable.

Also if you type some characters and a match can not be found
in the usual places for the normal menu, then it will
automatically try to find a system variable match.  For example
if you type a 'z' you would probably have a menu with 'zeroes('.
Then if you type a 't' it would give you a menu of 7 system
variables starting with 'zt' (assuming that there are no
variables, folders, or user defined strings that start with 'zt')

There is also an external database whose objects only appear
in the system variable menu.  This database is called:
'_sysext'  If you want access to some strings, but not so much
access that they clutter the main menu, then I suggest you put
such strings in here.

If you press 2nd + down in the entry line you will recieve a
menu of all system variables, the statistics system variables
will be listed first.

And in addition to having units, the unit menu replacement will
also have system variables, again the statistics variables will
be listed first. 





FLASH APP SUPPORT:
________________________________________________________________
Flash apps export functions using the following notation:

 nameOfFlashApp.exportedFunction()

This notation is similar to how variables are referenced.  The
name of the flash app is like a folder, the "." is like a "\"
and the exported function is like a variable name.

Support of flash apps functions is made to be similar to the
support of variables in the non-current folders.  First type
the name of the flashapp, (Of course typing could mean auto
completing) then type the ".",  you will now get a menu of
functions exported by the app.  Look for the function you want
or type more chars to narrow the search.

The data of the exported functions with each app is in an external
database.  The name of that external database must be the same
as the application name that is typed before the function name.
External databases are explained below.

I also suggest that you read the example in "things to try.txt"


If you did the following from the home entry line:

 {"utah","michigan","missouri","Illinois"}->us

You will have created an external database.

And if you cleared everything out of the entry line and then typed
"us." then you would have a menu suggesting "Illinois", "Missouri",
"Michigan", and "Utah".  So basically typing a "." after the name of
an external database results in a menu of all the items in that
external database.


Lucky for you this distribution includes external data bases made for
the finance, statistics, polynomial root finder applications, and the
calctools "concept" application.





UNIT MENU REPLACEMENT:
________________________________________________________________
Complete now provides a replacement for the tios unit menu.
This new unit menu works just like the unit menu that you
receive from Complete when you type an "_"

But this unit menu replacement is available from all tios
applications, not just the home app.

If you wish to get rid of it press escape.  F1-F8 will select
the corresponding text.  Up and down scroll; left and right
scroll the unit types.

It will not look for user defined units, but it will add items
from the external databases.

And there are two fake unit menus at the end:  One contains
the names of complete's variables.  The other has the names
of system variables.

There are shortcuts to skip around to different unit types.
If you can not remember them then press apps from the unit menu
replacement to have the shortcuts listed, from this listing you
can press a shortcut to jump to a unit type,  press up or down
to scroll this listing, anything else and it goes back to a menu
of the previous unit type.  Here they are:


	Obvious Shortcuts:
	_____________________________________
	c.....Constants
	l.....Length
	a.....Area
	v.....Volume
	t.....Time
	m.....Mass
	f.....Force
	e.....Energy
	p.....Power
	r.....Resistance



	Semi Obvious Shortcuts:
	_______________________________________________________
	k.....Viscosity, Kinematic: 	Think k for kinematic
	d.....Viscosity, Dynamic:	Think d for dynamic
	i.....Current:			In equations current is refered to as I
	s.....Conducance:			Think s for siemens
	g.....Magnetic Flux Density:	Think g for gauss
	w.....Magnetic flus:		Think w for weber
	x.....External variables:	Think x for _xtrast1
	n.....Amount of substance	N is often used for this like in the ideal
						gas law: p*v=n*r*t
	q.....Charge:			Q is used as charge in equations



	Non Obvious Shortcuts:
	________________________________________
	y.....System Variables
	z.....Velocity
	^.....Acceleration: The carrot sort of looks like an A
	b.....temperature
	j.....Luminous intensity
	o.....Pressure	
	u.....Potential

	space.....Capacitance
	enter.....Magnetic field Strength
	home......Inductance on 89
	=.........Inductance on the 92+





USER DEFINED STRINGS:
________________________________________________________________
It is easy for the user to define custom strings that they
want to appear in the menu.

Note that all external databases must be in the main folder.

The custom strings are kept in a list variables called "_xtrast1"
and "_xtrast2".  The elements will be the strings.  Here is an
example:

 {"sma()","bill()","jack","samuel","{x,y}"} -> _xtrast1


Internally the above string is stored as:

 {"{x,y}","samuel","jack","bill()","sma()"}


So if you type an s, "samuel" will be printed before "sma()" in
the menu but if you want "sma()" to be before "samuel" then you
will have to reverse the relative positions "samuel" and "sma()"
are in the list.

Important:	Only put strings as each element.  And do not forget
		quotes.  And you can not have external strings that
		start with a number, '.', '\' or the degree character.
		They simply will not be recognized.

Also if there is a ':' in the string then complete behaves as
though everything after it does not exist.  However the text after
the ":" will still be printed in the menu.  For example "Sam:Knife"
behaves like it is just "Sam".  See the constants unit menu. In fact
if you auto complete some string then complete will print in the help
line the stuff after the ':' character.  All spaces immediately after
the ':' char will not be printed in the help.

The help string must be more than 1 char long else it will not be
printed.

NOTE: to have help printed in the help line the ':' character must be
within the first 39 characters.


You can also have an external database for each unit type.  Each external
database for each type of unit has it's own name.  So first type the "_".
Then the unit menu will appear.  It would be silly to memorize these
names or always needing to look in this text file for the names, so the
last unit menu is fake and does not have units in it, instead it has all
the variable names.  Very nice see?

Left/right wrapping has been implemented so to get to this menu from the
initial unit menu of constants you only have to press the left arrow three
times.  You must not forget the '_' character at the beginning of each
string in the list, otherwise they will not be found as a match for the
unit that you are typing.


	Variable Name		Unit Type/Menu It Is Associated With
	______________________________________________________________
	_xtrast1................Not associated with a unit type.
					Items are placed in the normal menu
					before the default strings.
	_xtrast2................Not associated with a unit type.
					Items are placed in the normal menu
					after the default strings.
	_sysext.................Not associated with a unit type.
					Items are placed in a the system
					variable menu after the default
					system variable strings.
	_cnstant................Constants

	_capacit................Capacitance
	_magfstr................Magnetic Field Strength
	_magflxd................Magnetic Flux Density
	_magflux................Magnetic Flux
	_induct.................Inductance





ORDERING OF THE MATCHES:
_________________________________________________________________
The matches will be presented in the following order:

-Matches from the external database: _xtrast1.
-Matches from the default database: cmpltdat.
-Matches from the external database: _xtrast2.
-Folder names.
-Names of variables in the current folder.

If no matches are found in these five places then it looks
through the default database of system variables.

If you want to instantly have a list of folders followed by
variables then press the right arrow.  If you want to go back
to the commands then press the left arrow.

And if a unit menu is visible then just the units are displayed
followed by the custom units of that particular unit menu.





KNOWN "BUGS", QUIRKS, AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE QUIRKS:
________________________________________________________________
-In the unit menu replacement I did not provide a shortcut
 to the earth constants.

-Complete will not paste more than 39 characters at once.
 This does not mean that strings in the external database
 are limited to 39 characters.  You can still have extra
 characters behind the ':' that you wish to be printed in
 the help line.

 And though it will paste no more than 39 characters, if you do
 not choose the string you want within the typing the first 8
 characters of it, complete will stop trying to give sugestions.
 Complete is only intended to aid in the typing of expression,
 nothing more.

-Do not expect complete to function correctly with char(1).

-If Complete does a search and finds no matches the menu will
 be removed.  This is very logical but suppose you had a menu of
 commands starting with "z", and pressed right to get only the
 folders and variables that started with "z".  If there are no
 variables that start with "z" there will be no matches and thus
 the menu will disappear.

-Entire matches will not be given as an option.

-It will prevent user strings from being wider than the menu but
 it does this calculation based on the number of characters, not
 the actual width (remember small font is proportional) so even
 if there is still room to display a string, it might still be
 truncated and ellipses will be appended.

-If no menu is visible when a key is pressed complete will gather
 characters between the cursor and the first "separation
 character" that comes before the cursor.  If there are more than
 8 characters between the cursor and the "separation character"
 then complete will not bother to give any suggestions.

 Separation characters are characters which commands can possibly
 come after.  Here are the easily typed ones:

	"{}()[]+-/*= ,'%&#!;:

 Tios treats stuff after pi, e, i, and infinity as implied multiplication
 so I made them separation characters.  The unit conversion character by
 itself is an operator like '+' so I made it a separation character.

-It is possible to have an item in an external file start with one
 of these separation characters.  For example if you had "{x,y}"
 in _xtrast1 and you had typed: "solve(8x=y and y=x^3,{" then you
 would have a menu with {x,y} in it regardless of the "{" being one
 of those separation characters.

 Another example of this are the default strings that start with the
 conversion character.  If you type it then you get a menu suggesting
 the different conversions.  If you then typed an underscore the menu
 changes to contain units.  If the conversion char was not a separation
 character then it would search for ">_" and no unit results would be
 found.  And you want units because obviously you are doing a conversion.

-It does not do the automatic paste and highlight thing if the one
 item is a unit menu, the one thing in the menu is a name of a folder,
 backspace was just pressed, or only one character has been entered (so
 if you type x you probably only want to use it as a variable and not
 have "xor ")  This is deliberate.


-When it does initial processing, like looking for a separation
 character before the cursor, it does not consider the characters
 after the cursor.  I think this is good, because then it will
 give completion suggestions for commands that you might be trying
 to insert.

-It will not offer completion suggestions for strings starting with
 numbers.





FUTURE PLANS:
_________________________________________________________________
I have decided not to add functionality with other apps:  There
is too much dependency on the home text edit structure.

User defined unit types.

Better support for other file extensions.

I am also thinking that F of the function key labels before each
string in the pop up is unnecessary so I might get rid of them.

Maybe a replacement for tios's recall box.





CONTACTING THE AUTHOR:
_________________________________________________________________
I can be contacted by email at samuel@nyall.net  When
reporting bugs first download the latest version of complete
from my homepage: http://www.nyall.net and see if the
bug still exists.

Please be very specific as to your rom version, kernel, kernel
version, hardware version, other event hooks installed, and
whether or not you have the Hardware II patch installed.  If you
can try to reproduce the error with no kernel or any other event
hooks installed.  And please give a detailed description of what
happened.

Also I have ordered the strings so that the most commonly used
come first and the user does not have to scroll to get what he/she
wants.  If you think I did not do a good job of this then please
give me suggestions as to how it can be improved.

And If you think that complete is the greatest thing since sliced
bread then I would be glad to hear it.





THE FINE PRINT:
___________________________________________________________________
Complete may be distributed without permission as long as no profit
  is made off of that distribution.  If profit is being made on
  such a distribution then my permission is needed.  This includes
  but is not limited to CDs, floppies, and downloads off of an
  internet or ftp site.
Complete may not be distributed as part of another package without
  permission.
Do not separate the files in this zip archive or distribute a
  modified version of this zip archive.
I am not responsible for any crash, damage to calculator, or
  loss of data that might result from the use of complete.
The code is open source and if you borrow from it then give me
  some credit it your read me.
